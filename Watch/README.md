# ESP32 Watch

This is my attempt at building a simple smartwatch from scratch using the ESP32.  
Right now it’s mostly notes and early experiments, but I want to keep track of progress as I go.  

---

## Current Focus  
- Testing with the ESP32 devboard so I can debug the basics before worrying about a full PCB or case.  
- Looking at display options and experimenting with watch face designs

---

## Hardware Notes  
- ESP32 ESP-32S Development Board
- Display: TFT ST7789

---

## Design Thoughts  
- A good-looking watch face matters more than cramming in too many features. I want it to feel intentional, not cluttered.  
- Power efficiency has to be part of the design from the start.  
- Form factor will come later, but everything should stay as compact as possible.

## Roadmap  
1. Get a display running reliably with the ESP32.  
2. Draw and test custom watch faces.  
3. Add gyroscope support for standby/wake. 
4. Expand core functionality (weather, moon phases, steps, etc.).  
5. Move off the breadboard and onto a custom PCB/housing.

## Status  
Very early. Right now I’m treating this like a sandbox for hardware testing and design sketches.
